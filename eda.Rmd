Our first step is to explore our data set. The Kaggle website for the data set had relatively complete variable descriptions, but we will still need to confirm that the data does not contain any nonsensical values. 

``` {r EDA Part 1}
spotify = read.csv("spotify_dataset.csv")

```

Removing rows with time_signature = 0
```{r Filtering}
filtered_spotify <- 
  spotify %>% filter(time_signature != 0)

attach(filtered_spotify)



summary(filtered_spotify)
```

``` {r Plots}


```
