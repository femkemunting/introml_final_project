Our first step is to explore our data set. The Kaggle website for the data set had relatively complete variable descriptions, as well as 

``` {r EDA Part 1}
spotify = read.csv("spotify_dataset.csv")

```

Removing rows with time_signature = 0
```{r}
filtered_spotify <- spotify %>% filter(time_signature != 0)
summary(filtered_spotify)
```
