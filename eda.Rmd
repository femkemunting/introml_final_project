Our first step is to explore our data set. The Kaggle website for the data set had relatively complete variable descriptions, as well as 

``` {r EDA Part 1}
spotify = read.csv("spotify_dataset.csv")

```

Removing rows with time_signature = 0
```{r filtering}
filtered_spotify <- 
  spotify %>% 
  filter(
    time_signature %in% c(3, 4, 5, 6, 7))

attach(filtered_spotify)

# No missing values:

sum_isna <- sum(is.na(filtered_spotify))
sum_isna


# Count duplicates:

sum(duplicated(track_id))

# Check that the duplicates are the same for everything else
filtered_spotify %>% group_by(track_id)

```

``` {r Plotting}
plot(danceability ~ tempo)
plot(danceability, popularity)
